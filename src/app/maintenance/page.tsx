      <h1>Welcome to Gather Here</h1>
      <p>This website is currently under construction.</p>
      <h2>Our Goal</h2>
      <p>
        We aim to create an online platform that will match small groups of
        people by their location and their interests, and support them in
        planning Gatherings (In Real Life Meetings) supported and stimulated by
        material from our Library that is relevant to their interests.
      </p>
      <p>We want to help people find meaning, structure, and community.</p>
      <h2>Our Dreams</h2>
      <p className="w-full">
        Our dreams are primarily, to:
        <ul>
          <li>Address the problem of loneliness</li>
          <li>
            Empower people to engage with their communities and their world
          </li>
        </ul>
        And secondarily, to:
        <ul>
          <li>Foster a culture of evidence-based decision making</li>
          <li>Enable lifelong learning</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h2>Our Motivations</h2>
      <p>
        In our age of global wealth and interdependence, we are deprived of
        human connection.
      </p>
      <p>
        We describe our modern technology as something that connects us, when in
        many ways it drives us apart. It overwhelms us with information that has
        been unbound from context and nuance. It gives us many ways to
        communicate quickly across great distances, driving us to spend less
        time together physically. It wastes eons of our collective time by
        distracting us with advertising, untruth, rage, fear, and bottomless
        pits of content that makes us feel bad about ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        We hope to harness the connecting power of internet platforms to enable
        real-life, in-person human connection.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are currently developing our platform exclusively with volunteers in
        a number of countries. If you wish to get in contact please email us at:
